                            Owning a GOAT is not just about having a rare piece of digital art or a personalized avatar,
                            of course that's part of it, but really it's about gaining access to a vibrant and
                            successful COMMUNITY. A lot of our Road to Greatness (the GOAT roadmap) is about reinvesting
                            membership cost back into the community to drive content + projects. Prosperity awaits
                            beyond the front door and this is your key.
